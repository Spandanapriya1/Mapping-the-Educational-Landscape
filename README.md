**Mapping the Educational Landscape: A Data Analytics Study of Engineering Colleges in India**

**Project Overview**

This research is a thorough data analytics analysis of Indian engineering colleges with the goal of examining their ownership (private vs. public), facilities, tuition costs, distribution, and ranking trends. In order to help students, parents, legislators, and educational institutions make wise decisions, this study makes use of web scraping, data preparation, and visualization tools.

**Project Objectives**

Analyze the distribution of engineering colleges throughout Indian states.
Compare public and private colleges in terms of tuition fees, rankings, and infrastructure.
 Examine placement records, faculty qualifications, and financial aid availability.
Identify trends in educational hotspots such as Maharashtra and Kerala.
Provide data-driven recommendations for students, institutions, and policymakers.

**Data Collection & Preprocessing**

**1. Data Acquisition (Web Scraping & External Sources)**

The information came from a variety of sources, including:

For information on colleges, visit GetMyUni (https://www.getmyuni.com/all-colleges).
Tools Used:

BeautifulSoup & Requests: Gathering structured information from websites that list college openings.
NumPy and Pandas→ Data transformation and cleaning.

**2. Data Cleaning & Processing**

Handled missing values using mean/median imputation for numerical data.
Removed duplicate records to ensure dataset consistency.
Standardized fee structures and rankings to maintain uniformity across data sources.

**Processed Data Fields:**

College Name & Location
Public vs. Private Ownership
Tuition Fees 
Data Analysis & Key Insights

**1. Engineering College Distribution by State**

Maharashtra & Tamil Nadu have the highest number of engineering institutions.
Kerala has fewer institutions yet scores high in literacy and education quality.

**2. Ownership & Infrastructure Analysis**

Public colleges make up 65% of total institutions, offering affordable education.
Private institutions (35%) tend to have better infrastructure, faculty, and placement opportunities.
Recommendation: Public institutions need more investment in infrastructure to match private institutions.

**3. Tuition Fee Comparison: Public vs. Private Colleges**

Public colleges have a median fee of ₹90,000 per year.
Private institutions charge significantly higher fees (₹5–₹18 lakh), especially in metro cities.
Recommendation: To increase access to private colleges, financial aid and scholarship opportunities should be increased.

**4. Placement & Salary Trends**

Top-ranked colleges (e.g., IITs, NITs) have the highest placement rates and salary packages.
Average salary packages range from ₹4 LPA to ₹18 LPA, depending on college ranking.
Understanding that better placements are not always guaranteed by private universities with greater tuition costs, affordability is an important consideration.

**5. Ratings & Student Satisfaction**

Most colleges have a rating between 3.5 and 4.5.
Private colleges tend to have slightly higher ratings due to better facilities and career support.

**Visualization & Reporting**

Visualization Tools Used:

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data trends, bar charts, scatter plots.
Box Plots & Histograms: Tuition fee distribution and correlation with ratings.
Heatmaps: correlation between placement rates, faculty strength, and fees.
Key Business & Policy Recommendations

For parents and students: When choosing a college, take into account ratings, placements, and tuition costs.
For Institutions: Enhancing research facilities, faculty, and infrastructure should be the main priorities of public colleges.
For policymakers: To close the gap with private universities, public institutions require more money.

**Conclusion**

Making educated decisions is made easier for students, parents, and legislators thanks to the insightful information this data analytics study of engineering colleges in India offers. This project provides a data-driven method for enhancing higher education policy and decision-making by utilizing web scraping, visualization, and Python-based data analytics.
